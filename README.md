# MobileDevelopment_Week2Session2

This repository contains an implementation of some of the most commonly used widgets in flutter. 
Each widget has been implemented in its own flutter project - apart from Popup Menu, floating action button and Side Menu,
which have been implemented within the same project.

The widgets have been developed with the guidance of YouTube Tutorial Codes.
